% Uncomment the "nocite" line to have all entries in your bibliography listed,
% regardless of whether they were cited.  This is often helpful in discovering
% you had not referenced a source you intended, especially if, like me,
% you add useful sources to your bibliography file as you discover them.  If
% you don't add sources to your bibliography until you write text that cites
% them, you may never need this line.

% This should be a very high level overview of the novel work presented
