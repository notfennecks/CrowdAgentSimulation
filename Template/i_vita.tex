An example of a vita:\\
William Confer began his career in the field of Computer Science early,
being exposed to programming in the early 1980's at home and at the
Classical Junior Academy of St. Louis, Missouri.  Upon completing 
the Computer Science program at Illinois College in 1999, William
worked as a software developer for the Department of Veteran Affairs,
Veteran Hospital Division and then moved south to Auburn, Alabama where he began his graduate career.
While at Auburn University, William has worked mostly in the fields of 
character recognition and wireless software development.  His efforts in
character recognition have culminated in this thesis work and a U.S. patent
he shares with his advisor, Richard Chapman.
