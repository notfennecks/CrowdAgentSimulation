An example of acknowledgments:\\
This work is dedicated to the memories of my grandmother, Lois Hoffman, and my 
truest friend, Jacob Palmatier.  Lois passed recently after a twenty-plus year battle
with multiple sclerosis.  She is the inspiration behind the majority of my work with 
character recognition.  Jacob was killed by a roadside bomb in Iraq while retrieving the mail.  He
was my only friend who didn't criticize pursuing higher degrees for all these years.
I miss each of them terribly.

I would like to thank each of my committee members, especially Richard Chapman,
and my outside reader, Chwan-Hwa Wu, for their support over the years.  
Jaun Gilbert supplied the tablet computers
used to collect samples for my final studies.  Gerry Dozier's assistance in evolutionary
techniques was crucial to the success of my attempts to optimize recognition.  Mike Spiegel,
an undergraduate student from Depauw University, was a tremendous help in organizing and collecting 
character samples.
I would also like to acknowledge the contributions of the following students for their assistance in the past:
Charlton Barker,
Tyson Begly,
David Boyette,
Barry Burton,
Crystal Collings,
Jim Han,
Travia Holder,
Kevin Jackson,
Justin Limbaugh,
Adam Luter,
Deitrick Mathews,
John Morley,
Christopher Nuby,
Marcus Parker,
and Bradley Scott.
An additional round of thanks go to
Auburn University Technology Transfer for assistance in acquiring the patent 
and in seeking licensees for activity-based recognizers.

This work was sponsored in part by the Auburn University Center for
Innovations in Mobile, Pervasive, Agile Computing Technologies
(IMPACT) and the U.S. Department of Education 
Graduate Assistance in Areas of National Need (GAANN) Fellowship.
