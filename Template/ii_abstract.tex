An example of an abstract:\\
This work presents an algorithm for on-line character recognition that is fast,
portable, and consumes very little memory for code or data.  The
algorithm is alphabet-independent, and does not require training
beyond entering the alphabet once. This algorithm uses a novel, parameter-based method
of feature extraction, \textit{activity}, to achieve high recognition 
accuracy.  Recognition accuracy is shown to be improvable dynamically without
further input from the user. The algorithm brings the capability to do
character recognition to classes of devices that heretofore have not
possessed that capability because of limited computing resources,
including mobile handsets, PDAs, pagers, toys, and other small devices. It
achieves recognition speeds of 16.8 characters per second on a 20MHz, 8-bit
microcontroller without floating-point.  The alphabet-independent
nature of the algorithm combined with its inherent resistance to regular noise interference
may allow it to enhance the capability of persons with impaired motor or nervous systems
to communicate with devices by writing or gesturing commands.  
Additionally, two human studies demonstrate the effectiveness of a simple,
activity-based recognizer for users of the stylized Graffiti alphabet and for
non-stylized variants of the English alphabet.  A final experiment shows how
recognition accuracy can be improved per user by modifying the parameters of
the activity metric over samples collected in the non-stylized study.
